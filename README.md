# Temperature Meter

## Description
The Temperature Meter project is an embedded system designed to measure and display temperature using a microcontroller. This project utilizes the PIC18F4620 microcontroller to interface with a temperature sensor and provide real-time temperature readings on an LCD display to select should it open the air conditioner or the Heater

## Features
- Real-time temperature measurement
- LCD display for temperature readout
- Accurate temperature sensing with [specific sensor model]
- Easy calibration and configuration
